# 06-server-side-apis-weather-dashboard

In this homework I build a weather dashboard using the open weather api. This week there was no code files given to use so I created everything from scratch. I created the HTML / CSS and JavaScript. I used bootstrap to help with the layout of the page. Styled the page with CSS and created the functionality with JavaScript. This weather dashboard lets you search for a city and it will display the weather, temp, humidity and uv index. It also will give you the forecast for the next five days. Also it saves a button everytime for you to go back to that city if you would like to do so. 

- Created the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files

- Used the openweatherAPI to gather data when a user searches a city then you get data back that you are able to use and display on the page.  

- Used local storage to save the city so it can be used back on the buttons when they are click to display the data of that saved city.
